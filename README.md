ðŸ‘‹ hi, i'm val (they/them || she/her)

i've been everywhere, from css and js to boot firmware. i like type systems, monads, sandboxes, kernels, protocols, parsers, simd registers, pcbs, just lots of things. don't like real numbers at all though. those are too hard

i'm best known for [TiddlyPWA](https://tiddly.packett.cool/), libraries like [systemstat](https://crates.io/crates/systemstat) and [secstr](https://crates.io/crates/secstr), the [SoundFixer add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/soundfixer/), contributions to [FreeBSD](https://val.packett.cool/contrib/freebsd/), [Wayland](https://val.packett.cool/contrib/wayland/) and [Firefox](https://val.packett.cool/contrib/firefox/)

for more, visit [my personal home page](https://val.packett.cool/) and [my codeberg.org profile](https://codeberg.org/valpackett)â€”i moved most of my personal projects to codeberg because a non-profit forge is more appropriate for them

please support me [on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/valpackett)! and read work reports there!
