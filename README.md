ðŸ‘‹ hi, i'm val (they/them)

i've been everywhere, from css and js to boot firmware. i like type systems, monads, sandboxes, kernels, protocols, parsers, simd registers, pcbs, just lots of things. don't like real numbers at all though. those are too hard

please visit [my personal home page](https://val.packett.cool/) and [my codeberg.org profile](https://codeberg.org/valpackett) (i moved most of my personal projects to codeberg because a non-profit forge is more appropriate for them)

and you can support me [on patreon](https://www.patreon.com/valpackett)!
